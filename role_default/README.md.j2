## Requirements

There are no special requirements not covered by Ansible itself.



## Role variables

See [`defaults/main.yml`](./defaults/main.yml) for all available role parameters and their description. [`vars/main.yml`](./vars/main.yml) contains variables you should not override (but their descrption might be interesting).

Additionally, there are variables read from other roles and/or the global scope (e.g. host or group vars) as follows:

* None right now.



## Dependencies

See `dependencies` in [`meta/main.yml`](./meta/main.yml).



## Example playbook

None right now.



## Supported tags

It might be useful and faster to only call parts of the role by using tags:

* `setup`: Setup tasks like package installations (mostly one-time).
* `config`: Creates / updates configuration files and related resources.
* `service`: Creates / updates service related files and manages their state.
* `always`: Preparation task at start as well as clean-up task during completion. May be called explicitly to force a cleanup (for example leftovers when there was an unexpected interruption).



## Compatibility

See `platforms` in [`meta/main.yml`](./meta/main.yml).
