# Molecule verify playbook.
#
# Ansible's declarative approach already verifies execution success during
# converge (e.g., package installation failures). This optional playbook
# therefore has a focus on confirming system state and if expected behaviors
# are present.
#
# Typical checks:
#
# - Service running/stopped status matches intent
# - Network services listening on correct ports
# - User permissions properly limited
# - Some special configuration values set correctly
