# Internal role variables and values NOT meant to be overridden by a user.
#
# A variable in here usually overrides previous versions of that variable (if
# any) as this file has a quite high precedence. There should be a comment above
# each variable to explain its purpose.

# List of facts required by the role to function correctly. To identify which
# subset a fact belongs to during development, you can use the following:
# - ansible.builtin.setup:
#     gather_subset:
#       - '!min'
#       - '<subset_name, see parameter doc for details>'
__{{ role_name }}_required_facts:
  # subset "distribution"
  - "ansible_distribution123"
  - "ansible_distribution_version"


# Overwrite defaults of dependencies used by this role (of any)

# nothing right now
