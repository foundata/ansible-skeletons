# Static base inventory (subject to dynamic updates at runtime)
#
# This file pre-defines empty inventory groups used by this scenarios's Molecule
# playbooks. It ensures the groups always exist, even before the 'create' phase
# generates the dynamic inventory with actual container hosts.
#
# Without this file, phases like 'cleanup', 'destroy', and 'syntax' that run
# before 'create' would emit warnings about unmatched host patterns.
