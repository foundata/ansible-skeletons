# Configuration for the Ansible Molecule "ee" (Execution-environment) scenario.
#
# This scenario tests that the artifact can be included in an Ansible Execution
# Environment (EE) built with ansible-builder.
#
# See the official documentation for details on this file and all settings:
# https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/molecule/configuration/
#
# This scenario uses Podman to create and manage a container based testing
# environment. Ensure Podman is installed on your system to use it:
# https://podman.io/docs/installation.
#
# Podman is an alternative to Docker, offering improved security and better
# systemd integration. Additionally, it is typically easier to install, as
# most distributions provide a fully-features package it in their default
# repositories.
