# Internal role variables and values that must NOT be overridden by the user.

# Variables defined here usually override earlier definitions due to the high

# List of facts used by the role (gathered on a best-effort basis if needed).
#
# To identify which subset a fact belongs to during development, you can use
# the following snippet:
#
# - ansible.builtin.setup:
#     gather_subset:
#       - '!min'
#       - '<subset_name, see parameter doc for details>'
__run_{{ collection_name }}_used_facts:
  # from subset "distribution"
  - "distribution"
  - "distribution_major_version"
  - "distribution_version"
  - "os_family"


# List of platforms this role supports and was designed for.
#
# A warning will be issued if the list contains values and the role is executed
# on an unknown (not listed) platform, but execution will continue. Example:
#
# - name: "Fedora" # A ansible_facts value ('distribution' or 'os_family')
#   versions: # A ansible_facts value ('distribution_major_version' or
#     - "all" # 'distribution_version') or "all"
# - name: "Ubuntu"
#   versions:
#     - "22.04"
#     - "24.04"
# - name: "RedHat"
#   versions:
#     - "all"
# - name: "Debian"
#   versions:
#     - "all"
__run_{{ collection_name }}_supported_platforms:
  [] # Remove the "[]" when adding values to this list.


# List of package names to be installed when run_{{ collection_name }}_state is
# set to "present".
__run_{{ collection_name }}_packages_install:
  [] # Remove the "[]" when adding values to this list.


# List of package names to be uninstalled when run_{{ collection_name }}_state is
# set to "absent". This variable is useful when __run_{{ collection_name }}_packages_install
# contains packages that are required for the managed software to function but
# should not be removed during uninstallation, as doing so could break other
# software. This is usually the case if there are common dependencies like
# "curl" or "openssl" which typically should remain installed even after
# uninstalling the software managed by this role.
__run_{{ collection_name }}_packages_uninstall: "{{ '{{ run_' + collection_name  + '_packages_install }}' }}"


# List of package names to be removed unconditionally before installation
# (e.g., to prevent conflicts or resolve incompatibilities).
__run_{{ collection_name }}_packages_removal:
  [] # Remove the "[]" when adding values to this list.


# Override defaults of dependencies used by this role (if any).
