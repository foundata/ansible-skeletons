# You can copy this file into a .yaml file with a unique filename. A common
# convention is to prefix the filename with the number of an issue or pull/merge
# request. This file uses the .txt extension to prevent antsibull-changelog from
# parsing it.
#
# Remove any sections that are not applicable to your changelog fragment.
#
# For more information, see the official documentation on

# The file format is YAML, but the values are typically written in
# reStructuredText (not Markdown).

breaking_changes:
  - >
    This section should only appear in major releases (MAJOR.0.0), according to
    semantic versioning.
  - >
    This is a multiline string using YAML's block scalar syntax. It needs no
    quoting and makes it easier to keep content readable. See
    https://yaml-multiline.info/ for examples. You can use this syntax for all
    strings.
  - >
    It should include migration notes and `links <https://example.com/>`__ to
    help existing users adapt to the changes.
  - "Examples follow."
  - >
    The ``foo_api`` module no longer accepts the ``password_plain`` option. Use
    ``password_secure`` instead. If you previously supplied passwords via
    ``password_plain``, update your configuration accordingly.
  - >
    Support for Ansible Core 2.15 has been dropped. Please upgrade to at least
    Ansible Core 2.16 or continue using an earlier version of this collection.
