# You can copy its contents into a .yaml file with a unique filename (a number
# of an issue or pull/merge request is usually a good filename prefix; this
# file uses the .txt extension to prevent parsing by antsibull-changelog).
#
# Simply remove any sections that are not applicable to your changelog fragment.
#
# For more information, see the official documentation on

# The file format is YAML, but the content of the values is typically written
# in reStructuredText (not Markdown).
