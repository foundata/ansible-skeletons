# Test {{ collection_name }} Collection

This repository contains the `{{ namespace }}.{{ collection_name }}` Ansible Collection.


## Requirements<a id="requirements"></a>

There are no special requirements not covered by Ansible itself.


## Dependencies<a id="dependencies"></a>

See `dependencies` in [`galaxy.yml`](./galaxy.yml).



## Using this collection

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install {{ namespace }}.{{ collection_name }}
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: {{ namespace }}.{{ collection_name }}
```

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install {{ namespace }}.{{ collection_name }} --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax where `X.Y.Z` can be any [available version](https://galaxy.ansible.com/{{ namespace }}/{{ collection_name }}):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install {{ namespace }}.{{ collection_name }}:==X.Y.Z
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.
